## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

### What I learned

Recap over some of learnings while working through this project.

First, i would like to have a better  UI/UX design

Looked up way to use localStorage to use a 24 hour reset on the marked off buttons

```js
    const getCurrentDate = () => {
      const now = new Date()
      const year = now.getFullYear()
      const month = String(now.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0")
      const day = String(now.getDate()).padStart(2, "0")
      return `${year}-${month}-${day}`
    }
```

### Continued development

Add more functionality, like a clock countdown for the day

### Useful resources

- MDN and ChatGPT were very helpful, especially setting up the 24 hour reset.
